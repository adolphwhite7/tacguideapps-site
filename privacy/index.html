            <p class="disclaimer-note">This is an unofficial, fan-made app. Third-party marks referenced herein remain the property of their respective owners. See our <a href="/bo7/">Support Page</a> for the full disclaimer.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Mastermind Group Ventures LLC ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects information in connection with the Unofficial Tactical Guide for Black Ops 7 Players mobile application (the "App") and the tacguideapps.com website (the "Site"). By using the App or Site, you agree to the practices described in this Policy.</p>

            <h2>Controller and Contact Details</h2>
            <p>Mastermind Group Ventures LLC is responsible for operating the App and Site.</p>
            <p>
                Mastermind Group Ventures LLC<br>
                11357 Nuckols Rd, Suite 1029<br>

            </p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect minimal information to operate and improve the App and Site:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Analytics and Crash Data:</strong> We use Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics to collect aggregated, non-personally-identifiable information about app usage, performance, and crashes. This may include device type, operating system version, general usage patterns, and error logs. We have configured these services with privacy-preserving settings: Google Signals is off, IP anonymization is enabled, and we do not collect advertising identifiers (IDFA).</li>
                <li><strong>User-Submitted Ratings:</strong> If you submit star ratings (1–5 stars) for tactical tips within the App, we store those ratings to display aggregated scores. Ratings are not linked to any personal account or identifier.</li>
                <li><strong>Support Requests:</strong> If you contact us by email, we collect the information you provide, such as your email address and the content of your message, to respond to your inquiry.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Logs:</strong> Our hosting provider may automatically collect technical information such as IP addresses and access times in server logs for security and operational purposes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Operate, maintain, and improve the App and Site.</li>
                <li>Analyze usage trends and diagnose technical issues.</li>
                <li>Respond to support requests and communicate with you.</li>
                <li>Protect against misuse, fraud, and security threats.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
            <p>We process information based on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The performance of a contract (providing the App and Site to you).</li>
                <li>Our legitimate interests, such as improving the App and Site, preventing abuse, and ensuring security.</li>
                <li>Your consent, where we are required to obtain it for specific activities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
            <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> We use third-party providers to host the Site, send email, and provide analytics and crash reporting (including Google/Firebase). These providers are allowed to use information only as needed to provide services to us.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect our rights or property, or respond to lawful requests by public authorities.</li>
                <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to appropriate confidentiality protections.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain analytics and crash data for as long as reasonably necessary to analyze performance trends and maintain the App, generally for up to 12–24 months, unless a longer period is required for legal or security reasons.</p>
            <p>We retain support emails and related correspondence for as long as needed to handle your request and for a reasonable period thereafter (for example, up to 24 months), unless required to keep them longer for legal purposes.</p>
            <p>We retain technical server logs for a limited period consistent with our hosting provider's practices and security needs.</p>

            <h2>International Transfers</h2>
            <p>The App and Site are operated from the United States, and information we collect may be stored and processed in the United States or other countries where our service providers are located. Data protection laws in these countries may differ from those in your country of residence. We take reasonable steps to protect information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
            <p>Depending on where you live, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal information, such as the right to request access, correction, or deletion. While Virginia's Consumer Data Protection Act may not apply to us at our current scale, we will make good-faith efforts to honor reasonable requests where technically and legally feasible.</p>
            <p>To exercise your rights or ask questions about this Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@mastermindgroupventures.com">info@mastermindgroupventures.com</a>. We may need to verify your identity before responding to your request.</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>The App and Site are not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete it as soon as reasonably possible. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@mastermindgroupventures.com">info@mastermindgroupventures.com</a>.</p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to help protect information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access. However, no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot promise or guarantee absolute security.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
            <p>The App and Site may contain links to third-party websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those third parties. We encourage you to review their privacy policies before providing them with any personal information.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will change the "Last updated" date below. If we make material changes, we may provide additional notice, such as by posting a banner or sending a notification where appropriate. Your continued use of the App or Site after changes become effective will mean you accept the updated Policy.</p>
